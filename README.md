alien_invasion

    Game developed using several modules in Python mainly PYGAME
    The scoreboard changes accordingly whenever the bullet group collides with the alien group
    Even it is ensured that the user will have limited chances (number of ships) in a particular game
    Whenever the user destroys all aliens in a particular level the game gives the user a new fleet with increased toughness
    Play button,display of level/high_score/current_score/no_of_ships_left are integrated
    We can have a little more fun by changing the bullet sizes and the game rules as required
